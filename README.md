<h1>Face Recognition Attendance System ðŸ‘¤âœ…</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
This project is a face recognition-based attendance system that automates the attendance process using facial recognition technology. It detects faces from images or live camera feed, matches them with stored images in the database, and marks attendance for recognized faces.

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>Face Detection: Detects faces from images or live camera feed using OpenCV.<br>
Face Recognition: Recognizes faces by comparing them with stored images in the database.<br>
Attendance Marking: Automatically marks attendance for recognized faces.<br>
Database Management: Manages the database of enrolled faces for recognition.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
